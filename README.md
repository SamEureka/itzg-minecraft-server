⛏️ Crafting on the Pi: Minecraft with itzg Docker and balenaCloud on Raspberry Pi
This project lets you turn your Raspberry Pi into a mighty Minecraft server, powered by the convenience of itzg's Docker container images and the scalability of balenaCloud.

Unleash the Pi's potential:

Lightweight efficiency: Enjoy smooth gameplay even on limited Pi resources thanks to Docker's optimized containerization.
Compact powerhouse: Host your server on a device that fits in your pocket, perfect for portable or space-saving setups.
Energy-friendly: The Pi's low power consumption translates to eco-conscious Minecraft adventures.
Combined with balenaCloud, you get:

Effortless setup: Deploy your server in minutes with pre-configured images and the user-friendly balenaCloud interface.
Automatic management: balenaCloud takes care of updates, backups, and resource allocation, leaving you free to build and explore.
Scalability: As your player base grows, easily adjust server resources on the fly.

Remember, the Raspberry Pi's processing power can vary depending on the model. For optimal performance, consider using a Pi 4 with at least 4GB of RAM.
